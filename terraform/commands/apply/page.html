<br/>
The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.<br/>
The most straightforward way to use terraform apply is to run it without any arguments at all, in which case it will automatically create a new execution plan (as if you had run terraform plan) and then prompt you to approve that plan, before taking the indicated actions.<br/>
Another way to use terraform apply is to pass it the filename of a saved plan file you created earlier with terraform plan -out=..., in which case Terraform will apply the changes in the plan without any confirmation prompt. <br/>
<br/>
Apply Options<br/>
The following options allow you to change various details about how the apply command executes and reports on the apply operation.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#auto-approve">-auto-approve</a>&nbsp;- Skips interactive approval of plan before applying. This option is ignored when you pass a previously-saved plan file, because Terraform considers you passing the plan file as the approval and so will never prompt in that case.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#compact-warnings">-compact-warnings</a>&nbsp;- Shows any warning messages in a compact form which includes only the summary messages, unless the warnings are accompanied by at least one error and thus the warning text might be useful context for the errors.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#input-false">-input=false</a>&nbsp;- Disables all of Terraform's interactive prompts. Note that this also prevents Terraform from prompting for interactive approval of a plan, so Terraform will conservatively assume that you do not wish to apply the plan, causing the operation to fail. If you wish to run Terraform in a non-interactive context, see <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/automation/automate-terraform?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS">Running Terraform in Automation</a>&nbsp;for some different approaches.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#json">-json</a>&nbsp;- Enables the <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/v1.1.x/machine-readable-ui">machine readable JSON UI</a>&nbsp;output. This implies -input=false, so the configuration must have no unassigned variable values to continue. To enable this flag, you must also either enable the -auto-approve flag or specify a previously-saved plan.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#lock-false">-lock=false</a>&nbsp;- Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is dangerous if others might concurrently run commands against the same workspace.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#lock-timeout-duration">-lock-timeout=DURATION</a>&nbsp;- Unless locking is disabled with -lock=false, instructs Terraform to retry acquiring a lock for a period of time before returning an error. The duration syntax is a number followed by a time unit letter, such as "3s" for three seconds.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#no-color">-no-color</a>&nbsp;- Disables terminal formatting sequences in the output. Use this if you are running Terraform in a context where its output will be rendered by a system that cannot interpret terminal formatting.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/apply#parallelism-n">-parallelism=n</a>&nbsp;- Limit the number of concurrent operation as Terraform <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/v1.1.x/graph#walking-the-graph">walks the graph</a>. Defaults to 10.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>All <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/plan#planning-modes">planning modes</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/v1.1.x/commands/plan#planning-options">planning options</a>&nbsp;for terraform plan - Customize how Terraform will create the plan.

For configurations using <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/settings/backends/local">the local backend</a>&nbsp;only, terraform apply also accepts the legacy options <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/settings/backends/local#command-line-arguments">-state, -state-out, and -backup</a>.<br/>
