<title>Memory Addresses</title>
</head><body><span style="color: #0000ff">Memory Addresses</span><br/>
Programmers casually refer to a memory address as the way to access the contents of<br/>
a memory cell. But when dealing with 80 × 86 microprocessors, we have to distin-<br/>
guish three kinds of addresses:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff">Logical address</span><br/>
Included in the machine language instructions to specify the address of an oper-<br/>
and or of an instruction. This type of address embodies the well-known 80 × 86<br/>
segmented architecture that forces MS-DOS and Windows programmers to<br/>
divide their programs into segments. Each logical address consists of a segment<br/>
and an offset (or displacement) that denotes the distance from the start of the seg-<br/>
ment to the actual address.<br/>
<br/>
A logical address consists of two parts: a segment identifier and an offset that speci-<br/>
fies the relative address within the segment. The segment identifier is a 16-bit field<br/>
called the Segment Selector &nbsp;while the offset is a 32-bit field.<br/>
<br/>
To make it easy to retrieve segment selectors quickly, the processor provides segmen-<br/>
tation registers whose only purpose is to hold Segment Selectors; these registers are<br/>
called cs , ss , ds , es , fs , and gs . Although there are only six of them, a program can<br/>
reuse the same segmentation register for different purposes by saving its content in<br/>
memory and then restoring it later.<br/>
Three of the six segmentation registers have specific purposes:<br/>
cs The code segment register, which points to a segment containing program<br/>
instructions<br/>
ss The stack segment register, which points to a segment containing the current<br/>
program stack<br/>
ds The data segment register, which points to a segment containing global and<br/>
static data<br/>
The remaining three segmentation registers are general purpose and may refer to<br/>
arbitrary data segments.<br/>
The cs register has another important function: it includes a 2-bit field that specifies<br/>
the Current Privilege Level (CPL) of the CPU. The value 0 denotes the highest privi-<br/>
lege level, while the value 3 denotes the lowest one. Linux uses only levels 0 and 3,<br/>
which are respectively called Kernel Mode and User Mode.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff">Linear address (also known as virtual address)<br/>
</span><br/>
A single 32-bit unsigned integer that can be used to address up to 4 GB—that is,<br/>
up to 4,294,967,296 memory cells. Linear addresses are usually represented in<br/>
hexadecimal notation; their values range from 0x00000000 to 0xffffffff .<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff">Physical address</span><br/>
Used to address memory cells in memory chips. They correspond to the electri-<br/>
cal signals sent along the address pins of the microprocessor to the memory bus.<br/>
Physical addresses are represented as 32-bit or 36-bit unsigned integers.<br/>
The Memory Management Unit (MMU) transforms a logical address into a linear<br/>
address by means of a hardware circuit called a segmentation unit; subsequently, a<br/>
second hardware circuit called a paging unit transforms the linear address into a<br/>
physical address (see Figure 2-1).<br/>

</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: 15pt">Segment Descriptors</span></span><br/>
Each segment is represented by an 8-byte Segment Descriptor that describes the seg-<br/>
ment characteristics. Segment Descriptors are stored either in the Global Descriptor<br/>
Table (GDT) or in the Local Descriptor Table (LDT).<br/>
Usually only one GDT is defined, while each process is permitted to have its own LDT if<br/>
it needs to create additional segments besides those stored in the GDT. The address and<br/>
size of the GDT in main memory are contained in the gdtr control register, while the<br/>
address and size of the currently used LDT are contained in the ldtr control register.<br/>

<br/>
</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Segmentation in Linux</span></span><br/>
All Linux processes running in User Mode use the same pair of segments to address<br/>
instructions and data. These segments are called user code segment and user data seg-<br/>
ment, respectively. Similarly, all Linux processes running in Kernel Mode use the<br/>
same pair of segments to address instructions and data: they are called kernel code<br/>
segment and kernel data segment, respectively. Table 2-3 shows the values of the Seg-<br/>
ment Descriptor fields for these four crucial segments.<br/>
The corresponding Segment Selectors are defined by the macros _ _USER_CS , _ _USER_DS ,<br/>
_ _KERNEL_CS , and _ _KERNEL_DS , respectively. To address the kernel code segment, for<br/>
instance, the kernel just loads the value yielded by the _ _KERNEL_CS macro into the cs<br/>
segmentation register.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, segmentation and paging are somewhat redundant, because both can be used <br/>
to separate the physical address spaces of processes: segmentation can assign a differ-<br/>
ent linear address space to each process, while paging can map the same linear<br/>
address space into different physical address spaces.<br/>

The <b>Global Descriptor Table</b>&nbsp;or <b>GDT</b>&nbsp;is a data structure used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel">Intel</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a>-family processors starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80286">80286</a>&nbsp;in order to define the characteristics of the various memory areas used during program execution, including the base address, the size and access privileges like executability and writability. These memory areas are called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation">segments</a></i>&nbsp;in Intel terminology.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The <i>GDT</i>&nbsp;can hold things other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_descriptor">segment descriptors</a>&nbsp;as well. Every 8-byte entry in the <i>GDT</i>&nbsp;is a descriptor, but these can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_State_Segment">Task State Segment</a>&nbsp;(or TSS) descriptors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Descriptor_Table">Local Descriptor Table</a>&nbsp;(LDT) descriptors, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Gate">Call Gate</a>&nbsp;descriptors. The last ones, Call Gates, are particularly important for transferring control between x86 privilege levels although this mechanism is not used on most modern operating systems.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
There is also an LDT or <i>Local Descriptor Table</i>. The LDT is supposed to contain memory segments which are private to a specific program, while the GDT is supposed to contain global segments. The x86 processors contain facilities for automatically switching the current LDT on specific machine events, but no facilities for automatically switching the GDT.<br/>
