<title>Paging</title>
</head><body>The paging unit translates linear addresses into physical ones. One key task in the<br/>
unit is to check the requested access type against the access rights of the linear<br/>
address. If the memory access is not valid, it generates a Page Fault exception<br/>
For the sake of efficiency, linear addresses are grouped in fixed-length intervals called<br/>
pages; contiguous linear addresses within a page are mapped into contiguous physi-<br/>
cal addresses. In this way, the kernel can specify the physical address and the access<br/>
rights of a page instead of those of all the linear addresses included in it. Following<br/>
the usual convention, we shall use the term “page” to refer both to a set of linear<br/>
addresses and to the data contained in this group of addresses.<br/>
The paging unit thinks of all RAM as partitioned into fixed-length page frames<br/>
(sometimes referred to as physical pages). Each page frame contains a page—that is,<br/>
the length of a page frame coincides with that of a page. A page frame is a constitu-<br/>
ent of main memory, and hence it is a storage area. It is important to distinguish a<br/>
page from a page frame; the former is just a block of data, which may be stored in<br/>
any page frame or on disk.<br/>
The data structures that map linear to physical addresses are called page tables; they<br/>
are stored in main memory and must be properly initialized by the kernel before<br/>
enabling the paging unit.<br/>
Starting with the 80386, all 80 × 86 processors support paging; it is enabled by set-<br/>
ting the PG flag of a control register named cr0 . When PG = 0 , linear addresses are<br/>
interpreted as physical addresses.<br/>

Starting with the 80386, the paging unit of Intel processors handles 4 KB pages.<br/>
The 32 bits of a linear address are divided into three fields:<br/>
<br/>
Directory<br/>
The most significant 10 bits<br/>
<br/>
Table<br/>
The intermediate 10 bits<br/>
<br/>
Offset<br/>
The least significant 12 bits<br/>

The translation of linear addresses is accomplished in two steps, each based on a<br/>
type of translation table. The first translation table is called the Page Directory, and<br/>
the second is called the Page Table<br/>
<br/>
The entries of Page Directories and Page Tables have the same structure. Each entry<br/>
includes the following fields:<br/>
<br/>
Present flag<br/>
If it is set, the referred-to page (or Page Table) is contained in main memory; if<br/>
the flag is 0, the page is not contained in main memory and the remaining entry<br/>
bits may be used by the operating system for its own purposes. If the entry of a<br/>
Page Table or Page Directory needed to perform an address translation has the<br/>
Present flag cleared, the paging unit stores the linear address in a control register<br/>
named cr2 and generates exception 14: the Page Fault exception. (We will see in<br/>
Chapter 17 how Linux uses this field.)<br/>
Field containing the 20 most significant bits of a page frame physical address<br/>
Because each page frame has a 4-KB capacity, its physical address must be a mul-<br/>
tiple of 4096, so the 12 least significant bits of the physical address are always<br/>
equal to 0. If the field refers to a Page Directory, the page frame contains a Page<br/>
Table; if it refers to a Page Table, the page frame contains a page of data.<br/>
<br/>
Accessed flag<br/>
Set each time the paging unit addresses the corresponding page frame. This flag<br/>
may be used by the operating system when selecting pages to be swapped out.<br/>
The paging unit never resets this flag; this must be done by the operating system.<br/>
Dirty flag<br/>
Applies only to the Page Table entries. It is set each time a write operation is per-<br/>
formed on the page frame. As with the Accessed flag, Dirty may be used by the<br/>
operating system when selecting pages to be swapped out. The paging unit never<br/>
resets this flag; this must be done by the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
Read/Write flag<br/>
Contains the access right (Read/Write or Read) of the page or of the Page Table<br/>
(see the section “Hardware Protection Scheme” later in this chapter).<br/>
<br/>
User/Supervisor flag<br/>
Contains the privilege level required to access the page or Page Table (see the<br/>
later section “Hardware Protection Scheme”).<br/>
<br/>
PCD and PWT flags<br/>
Controls the way the page or Page Table is handled by the hardware cache (see<br/>
the section “Hardware Cache” later in this chapter).<br/>
<br/>
Page Size flag<br/>
Applies only to Page Directory entries. If it is set, the entry refers to a 2 MB– or 4<br/>
MB–long page frame (see the following sections).<br/>
<br/>
Global flag<br/>
Applies only to Page Table entries. This flag was introduced in the Pentium Pro<br/>
to prevent frequently used pages from being flushed from the TLB cache (see the<br/>
section “Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB)” later in this chapter). It works<br/>
only if the Page Global Enable ( PGE ) flag of register cr4 is set.</body></html>
