</head><body>Processes can access only “opened” files. To open a file, the process invokes the sys-<br/>
tem call:<br/>
<br/>
fd = open(path, flag, mode)<br/>
<br/>
This system call creates an “open file” object and returns an identifier called a <span style="color: #0000ff">file<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000ff">descriptor.</span>&nbsp;An open file object contains:<br/>
<br/>
Some file-handling data structures, such as a set of flags specifying how the file<br/>
has been opened, an offset field that denotes the current position in the file from<br/>
which the next operation will take place (the so-called file pointer), and so on.<br/>
Some pointers to kernel functions that the process can invoke. The set of permit-<br/>
ted functions depends on the value of the flag parameter.<br/>
<br/>
We discuss open file objects in detail in Chapter 12. Let’s limit ourselves here to<br/>
describing some general properties specified by the POSIX semantics.<br/>
A file descriptor represents an interaction between a process and an opened file,<br/>
while an open file object contains data related to that interaction. The same<br/>
open file object may be identified by several file descriptors in the same process.<br/>
Several processes may concurrently open the same file. In this case, the filesys-<br/>
tem assigns a separate file descriptor to each file, along with a separate open file<br/>
object. When this occurs, the Unix filesystem does not provide any kind of syn-<br/>
chronization among the I/O operations issued by the processes on the same file.<br/>
However, several system calls such as flock( ) are available to allow processes to<br/>
synchronize themselves on the entire file or on portions of it (see Chapter 12).<br/>
To create a new file, the process also may invoke the creat( ) system call, which is<br/>
handled by the kernel exactly like open( ) .<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: 15pt">Accessing an opened file</span></span><br/>
Regular Unix files can be addressed either sequentially or randomly, while device<br/>
files and named pipes are usually accessed sequentially. In both kinds of access, the<br/>
kernel stores the file pointer in the open file object—that is, the current position at<br/>
which the next read or write operation will take place.<br/>
Sequential access is implicitly assumed: the read( ) and write( ) system calls always<br/>
refer to the position of the current file pointer. To modify the value, a program must<br/>
explicitly invoke the lseek( ) system call. When a file is opened, the kernel sets the<br/>
file pointer to the position of the first byte in the file (offset 0).<br/>
<br/>
The lseek( ) system call requires the following parameters:<br/>
newoffset = lseek(fd, offset, whence);<br/>
which have the following meanings:<br/>
fd<br/>
Indicates the file descriptor of the opened file<br/>
offset<br/>
Specifies a signed integer value that will be used for computing the new position<br/>
of the file pointer<br/>
whence<br/>
Specifies whether the new position should be computed by adding the offset<br/>
value to the number 0 (offset from the beginning of the file), the current file<br/>
pointer, or the position of the last byte (offset from the end of the file)<br/>
The read( ) system call requires the following parameters:<br/>
nread = read(fd, buf, count);<br/>
which have the following meanings:<br/>
fd<br/>
Indicates the file descriptor of the opened file<br/>
buf<br/>
Specifies the address of the buffer in the process’s address space to which the<br/>
data will be transferred<br/>
count<br/>
Denotes the number of bytes to read<br/>
When handling such a system call, the kernel attempts to read count bytes from the<br/>
file having the file descriptor fd , starting from the current value of the opened file’s<br/>
offset field. In some cases—end-of-file, empty pipe, and so on—the kernel does not<br/>
succeed in reading all count bytes. The returned nread value specifies the number of<br/>
bytes effectively read. The file pointer also is updated by adding nread to its previous<br/>
value. The write( ) parameters are similar.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Closing a file</span></span><br/>
When a process does not need to access the contents of a file anymore, it can invoke<br/>
the system call:<br/>
res = close(fd);<br/>
which releases the open file object corresponding to the file descriptor fd . When a<br/>
process terminates, the kernel closes all its remaining opened files.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: 17pt">Renaming and deleting a file</span></span><br/>
To rename or delete a file, a process does not need to open it. Indeed, such opera-<br/>
tions do not act on the contents of the affected file, but rather on the contents of one<br/>
or more directories. For example, the system call:<br/>
res = rename(oldpath, newpath);<br/>
changes the name of a file link, while the system call:<br/>
res = unlink(pathname);<br/>
decreases the file link count and removes the corresponding directory entry. The file<br/>
is deleted only when the link count assumes the value 0.</body></html>
